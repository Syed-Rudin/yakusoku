## Inspiration
yakusoku (約束) is a japanese phrase which refers to an appointment akin to a promise which cannot be broken; we wanted to create a solution for people who lack discipline or find it hard to stick to things such as a budget, or making it to things on time like 9am lectures!

## What it does
Make a contract with yourself to be fulfilled. It could be something you've been putting off for awhile, or a bad habit you keep repeating. Pick a deadline and a trusted friend to be your accountability partner. Your friend will be able to mark your contract as successful or failed based on your actions. In the case of a failure, a set amount of money will be sent to your friend as a penalty - and it'll likely sting enough that you won't make the same mistake again!

## How we built it
We wanted to build a mobile app so that this tool was accessible as possible. We decided to learn Swift and code on Xcode so we could control how the app looked at every step of the way. We built the app from the ground up, starting from the databases in Firebase to store user information, to functionality with Swift and frontend with SwiftUI.

## Challenges we ran into
This was our first time using Git so we lost a lot of time dealing with merge conflicts and navigating our  branches - things got messy fast and we had to sit down, look through all the work we had done and merge everything before we could move forward.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are extremely proud that this is our FIRST hackathon and we didn't bail out! We pushed past our comfort zones by using  Swift, SwiftUI and Firebase - technologies we've never used up till the morning of the hackathon, as well as getting really comfortable with git and working as a team. 

## What we learned
To not underestimate what can be done in 24 hours and to not give up even if a task may seem daunting and the challenges seem endless. We could not have such an amazing experience without first persevering through the endless issues that kept popping up.

## What's next for yakusoku
If we do get recognition for the app, we could definitely implement stronger security for user data. Furthermore, we could implement an API such as TrueLayer, which can connect user's bank accounts to the app so that the penalties can be directly transferred from one user to another (as we originally intended).
